# A collection of Skyblock links

(Mostly so I don't have to place a bookmark in every browser on every device)


You can check it out for yourself
**[here](https://aphased.github.io/skyblock-links)**,
or read the source file in this repo.


## PRs welcome!!

Add new links, or, if you don't feel like messing around with the pure HTML,
open a new [issue](https://github.com/aphased/skyblock-links/issues) with the
proposed link addition(s) and a brief description of what they do, and I can
look into adding them for you.
